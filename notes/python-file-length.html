        <p>i&#39;d like to dispel the notion that small files are good and long files are bad.</p>

<p>zen of python: Flat is better than nested.</p>

<hr>

<p>definitions:</p>

<p>module = a .py file</p>

<p>package = a directory containing an <code>__init__.py</code> and possibly other .py files or
packages.</p>

<hr>

<p>the main benefit of breaking up a module into a package is clarifying the
structure of the abstractions. the main cost of breaking up a file is that it
increases complexity by introducing indirection.</p>

<p>one way to think about it is to consider the contents of the module as a tree.
breaking up the module is in order when the depth of the tree &gt; 3. (for depth
1: module suffices, just put functions in the module, for depth 2: module
suffices, group using classes and/or naming)</p>

<p><code>__init__.py</code> is there to help create the desired API for the package (and
because python&#39;s module system uses them to discover packages). by default,
<code>__init__.py</code> should be empty. the only reasons to put code in <code>__init__.py</code> is
to hide some of structure of the abstractions in the package from its user.</p>

<p>the way to decide whether to break up a module into a package is to design the
API. breaking up modules without designing the API of the module/package is
adding indirection without good reason. the simplicity of the implementation of
the API is what determines whether the module should be broken up and what goes
in <code>__init__.py</code></p>

<p>all of these are are insufficient reasons to break up a module:</p>

<p>&ldquo;it is more than one class&rdquo; (it&#39;s python, not java :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;it is too many functions&rdquo; (use code folding)</p>

<p>&ldquo;it is too many lines&rdquo; (use code folding)</p>

<p>&ldquo;there are different kinds of classes/functions&rdquo; (ok if the API makes sense)</p>

<hr>

<h1>heuristics</h1>

<p>optimize for discoverability and readability. remember that there are many ways
to browse code: grep, editor, fuzzy search, web interface (like GH), ? and ??
in ipython, &hellip;</p>

<p>sometimes, but not always, long files indicate that there is nested structure
in the file.</p>

<p>sometimes, but not always, long files indicate that said structure should be
signaled to the user of the code.</p>

<p>sometimes, but not always, long files indicate that abstractions are violating
single-responsibility principle.</p>

<p>sometimes, but not always, long files indicate that the structure of a module
is &ldquo;long list&rdquo;.</p>

<p>if you feel like breaking up a module is in order, but defining and documenting
the API is too much work, you probably shouldn&#39;t break it up.</p>

<p>if you feel the need to document and define an API, consider making a package
instead of a module.</p>

<p>if there are analogous, but different, implementations of the same abstraction
and those abstractions have lower-level dependencies (e.g. json and xml
serializers) consider making a package.</p>

<p>in application code (as opposed to systems code or framework/library code)
packages should be rare.</p>

<p>django enforces or suggests a lot of the project structure, creating additional
structure may not be in-line with intended use.</p>

<p>consider whether the package you are creating should be a library/dependency.</p>

<hr>

<p>some of this is a matter of taste which makes it doubly important that
conventions are explicitly codified.</p>

<p>zen of python: Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<h1>quotes on this topic</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>One way to think about this is how will the developers/peers use the API. Will
my package be like one namespace like <code>from myframework import DB, Template</code> or
<code>from myframework.models import DB</code>.  This may help you to answer the question
of splitting the code based on functionality or perceivable abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree that the most important part of organizing code into files is making
the codebase readable. There are some nice advantages to having large files
that have all the code you need (single-file search and jumping around is
usually a nicer experience than multi-file). For most projects, I usually pick
an initial code organization strategy that&#39;s pretty simple and intuitive, and
try to keep different types of things in separate files for
clarity/organization. If some piece gets to be around 1000 lines, I usually
start thinking about breaking it up even if there isn&#39;t a clear organizational
benefit but there are always exceptions. Zulip&#39;s Python codebase has ~5 &gt;1000
line non-test files that I think would be worse if we broke them apart, and a
similar number of test files with the same property.  We also have some
subsystems, like our webhook integrations, that have a few files per
integration, and we&#39;re pretty happy with that model for that application.</p>
