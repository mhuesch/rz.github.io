        <h1>tl; dr;</h1>

<p>If you are going to do one thing, eat well. If you are going to do two things, eat well and lift weights. Eating well means eating real (non-processed) food, enough protein, a lot of vegetables, and not too much. Lift weights means following a program that includes the big 3 (squat, deadlift, and bench press) and whose resistance increases over time (ie you lift heavier weights as you progress). You are an experiment with sample size 1, experiment on yourself as rigorously as possible and measure the results.</p>

<h1>A Warning</h1>

<p>I am not going to get into how I know these things I think I know. The short version is that after developing some extremely bad diet &amp; (lack of) exercise habits I started getting sick very often, was always tired, and got depressed. A trip to the doctor revealed alarming cholesterol levels and several deficiencies, including a testosterone one. Also, the way I looked was eating away at my self-esteem. In getting out of all that I spent a lot of time learning about how various types of athletes train at various levels and about nutrition. At the same time I got in shape and improved my life in several ways. Here are some pictures I like to show because I&#39;m vain. The first two are taken about 1.5 years apart and the third a couple of months ago, which is 4 years after the first.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/isqhj2p4smlo7vr/Screen%20shot%202012-02-20%20at%209.07.15%20PM.png?dl=1" alt="before-after"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8n6ys3hjm343cuv/2015.png?dl=1" alt="now"></p>

<p>If nothing else you can rationalize listening to me because I&#39;ve executed a successful transformation and then kept it up. Vanity aside, the health problems I mentioned above have gone away.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Habits and Goals</h1>

<p><em>The long term is sooner than you think.</em></p>

<p><em>The hardest question in life is &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Fitness is 80% mental and 50% physical.</em></p>

<p>A good mindset is way more important to health &amp; fitness than any diet, exercise routine, training methodology, protocol, etc. To that effect, being honest with yourself is key. What are you trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>The most common answer is &ldquo;I don&#39;t know&rdquo;, but instead people tend to think &ldquo;I want to be generally healthy&rdquo;, which is the  same thing as not knowing, but more problematic. A problem with &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; is that at best it means different things to different people. For example, my dad used to practice bodybuilding some 20 years ago and he&#39;d have my mom weigh all his food, which a lot of people saw as crazy and as a sign of a bad relationship to food. They were right in some sense: obsessing over the nutritional content of what you eat to the point that you are measuring out portions down to the gram is obsessive. On the other hand, that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable thing to do for someone who is bodybuilding and therefore trying to achieve very low bodyfat.</p>

<p>The real problem with &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; is that it is a way to rationalize habits you&#39;ve heard from various ill-informed sources and avoid making concrete decisions about concrete things you want. I can probably construct an argument about how eating 3 pizzas a day is healthy.</p>

<p>So, in case you don&#39;t know what you want, I offer you some potential answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want your body to look good</li>
<li>you want to live a long time</li>
<li>you want to be alert and feel good most of the time</li>
<li>you want to gain or lose weight</li>
<li>you want to do several of the above without spending too much time on it</li>
<li>you want to do several of the above while still eating certain foods</li>
<li>you want to be able to play sports without getting fatigued</li>
<li>you want to run a marathon</li>
<li>you want to do manual labor all day without getting injured</li>
<li>you want your blood-work to show acceptable levels of cholesterol</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that a lot of these are compatible with each other, so you don&#39;t have to pick one. The bad news is that we, as a civilization, do not know very much about the human metabolism, especially about what happens in the long-term (~decades). So, things like the second one are probably not worth bothering with. The light at the end of the bad news is that we do know a bit about effects in the short- and mid-term (~months, ~years). In a nutshell: I can&#39;t tell you how to live a long time or what to do now to ensure that you&#39;ll meet your fitness goals in 50 years, but I can tell you how to achieve certain goals in a couple of years. For one last piece of bad news, most of these things take a couple of years and not a couple of months, though you do start seeing progress a few months in.</p>

<p>Because we&#39;re talking about several months or a couple of years, you should focus on building habits (as opposed to doing things that you can get yourself to do for short periods of time). Building habits is a negotiation with yourself, though. When people try to do something too drastic that takes too much willpower they tend to drop the habit quickly. So, for example, you&#39;ll have two problems: the first is that once you start going to the gym consistently it&#39;ll take ~6 months to start seeing results; the second is that it is psychologically hard to get yourself to go to the gym consistently in the first place.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that you are in it for the longish term can be helpful when you fall out of a certain habit (e.g. when you miss the gym for 2 weeks). You should be kind to yourself and forgive yourself quickly when you fall out of habit. A psychological pitfall that affects a lot of people is that once they fall out of habit for a short period they think that all their progress is destroyed &ndash; this is not the case, a week is only a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>Putting all this together: the right psychological mindset is that you&#39;re developing habits conducive to concrete fitness goals achievable in a couple of years.</p>

<h1>Diet</h1>

<p><em>You are what you eat.</em></p>

<p><em>6-packs are made in the kitchen.</em></p>

<p><em>Show me someone who can&#39;t gain or lose weight and I&#39;ll show you someone who doesn&#39;t track what he eats.</em></p>

<p><em>But I really like nutella.</em></p>

<p>Your diet is the most important thing about your health &amp; fitness.</p>

<p>Some aspects of this should be obvious e.g. you shouldn&#39;t expect to eat 5000 calories a day (ie a lot) and be skinny. But some aspects aren&#39;t so obvious, e.g. after a certain point it becomes impossible to make progress in weightlifting without eating enough &ndash; regardless of what you do at the gym.</p>

<h2>Food is Complicated</h2>

<p>Food is very complicated, probably more complicated than you think. Furthermore, the way that food interacts with your body is also very complicated, again probably more than you think. For example, oregano is made of over 60 chemical compounds, most of which are complicated molecules. To make matters worse, here&#39;s a diagram of the metabolic pathways that some chemical compounds take in your body:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nawxtj18nwvpixn/metabolic-pathways.jpg?dl=1" alt="metabolic pathways"></p>

<p>Again, we, as a civilization, do not understand the way in which all these things interact. We have some ideas, but they are rough and you may be an exception to a given model that works well in many cases. Not only that but the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of what is good nutrition changes every couple of decades in incompatible ways e.g. in the 70s and 80s people though that fats were very bad, which is now widely believed to be wrong. Fortunately, we know how to survive because we&#39;ve been doing it for several hundred thousand years and not because we listen to what people say about nutrition in fitness magazines.</p>

<p>All of this complexity coupled to some thinking around knowns vs unknown-unknowns yields that you should eat food that is as close as possible to how it is found in nature.</p>

<p>Of course, this is remarkably difficult to do because it is impossible to determine whether something has been chemically processed by humans. For example, wild almonds contain cyanide &ndash; you probably shouldn&#39;t eat a wild almond. But, almonds do count as real food even though the almonds that you eat are &ldquo;domesticated&rdquo; because the domestication process mostly involves artificial selection. At the other extreme, candy mostly made up of corn syrup and artificial flavoring is obviously not real food. The rule of thumb here is to err as much as possible towards real food even though you won&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<p>Summary: eat real food.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p>While the chemical composition of food is very complicated, a more macroscopic description of food is relatively straight forward. For most health &amp; fitness goals in 2-year scales, one mostly needs to only worry about food at this macro level. Here macro means macronutrient. Macronutrients are basically categories of nutrients separated by our rough understanding of the short- and mid-term effects they have on the metabolism. There are three of them: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All food is mostly made up of things that fall in those three categories. Any one food will also contain another few dozen chemical compounds that don&#39;t fall in those categories, but 99% of the mass of the food does fall into the 3 categories.</p>

<p>If you live in the modern western world and don&#39;t pay attention to your diet you most likely eat too many carbohydrates and not enough protein.</p>

<p>Also, if you ever want to annoy someone who lifts weights just declare that nuts are a good source of protein. Darn, I just annoyed myself.</p>

<p>Theories on carbohydrates and their effects vary, but it is relatively well established that eating fewer carbs leads to weight loss and that people can live happily (and happier) with very few carbs.
If you are not an athlete (ie you don&#39;t exercise rigorously for more than 2 hours a day) you should aim to eat about 200g of carbohydrates per day. If you are trying to lose weight you should aim for closer to 100g. Lastly, if you are trying to lose a lot of weight (e.g. ~100lbs or more) an effective way to do it is to follow a ketogenic (aka &ldquo;keto&rdquo;) diet in which you would eat fewer than 25g of carbs per day. More on how to actually go about counting your macros below.</p>

<p>Again, theories and opinions on protein vary, but it is also well established that not eating enough protein makes it difficult to make athletic progress. Each day, you should aim to eat at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 165lbs you should eat 165g of protein each day. This will likely seem like too much once you translate it into food (it&#39;s about a pound of meat plus some other high-protein foods), but this is the right amount.</p>

<p>While it is possible to eat enough protein without eating meat, it requires a lot more effort, and most likely requires that a large portion of your diet come from processed foods (e.g. rice protein powder or high-protein meat alternatives). I understand the ethical implications of eating meat (I used to be a vegetarian for this reason) but it is very difficult to be in good health &amp; fitness and also be vegetarian (this is why I stopped being vegetarian).</p>

<p>As for fats, they should make up the rest of your diet. Again, more on how to count your macros below.</p>

<p>Summary: eat less bread, eat more protein.</p>

<h2>Micros</h2>

<p>So, 99% of food is carbs, protein, and fat. What about the other 1%? That&#39;s probably also important, but our present understanding of the relevant mechanisms is very rudimentary. The only thing to do about that is to hope to cover your bases by eating a lot of vegetables. Most leafy greens have high concentrations of micro-nutrients (especially kale, brussels sprouts, and collards).</p>

<p>The good news, in terms of health &amp; fitness (or at least aesthetics) is that vegetables are &ldquo;mostly nothing&rdquo; in the sense that they have very few calories. Put another way, they are made of water, empty space, micro-nutrients, and only a little foodstuff. This is especially true of leafy greens.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t pay attention to your diet and live in the modern western world, you are probably deficient in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. It is a good idea to take supplements of both of those.</p>

<h2>Calories</h2>

<p>A calorie is a unit of energy. The calories you see in labels of food in the US are kilocalories ie 1000 calories. From now on I&#39;ll just call them calories, when I technically mean kilocalories, to conform to US convention.</p>

<p>Saying how many calories something has is a rough way of expressing how much foodstuff is in a given food. This is useful because the composition of food makes it difficult to compare foods by weight. For example, a pound of kale has about 100 calories, while a pound of meat has about 1200. If you only ate kale, in order not to starve you&#39;d have to eat about 20 pounds per day, whereas you could get by on less than 2 pounds of meat.</p>

<p>The way we measure the caloric content of food is by burning it and measuring how much energy is emitted in the process. Needless to say, that is not what happens in your body when you digest food, and is therefore a crude estimate. So, as a scientific model the &ldquo;calories in/calories out&rdquo; model is obviously wrong. On the other hand, counting calories can be very useful to achieving fitness goals. Just keep in mind that there is more to it.</p>

<p>Some useful numbers to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pound of fat is 3500 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of protein is 4 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of carbohydrates is 4 calories</li>
<li>1 gram of fat is 9 calories</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of designing your diet by thinking about the carbs, protein, and fat, it is generally easier to do it in terms of calories, protein and carbs.</p>

<h2>Designing Diets</h2>

<p>This is where you put it all together.</p>

<p>Remember that everything is an estimate &ndash; your total daily expenditure is an estimate, you caloric intake is an estimate, your protein intake is an estimate, etc. In order to achieve extreme results you&#39;ll need to have some very good estimates. But 80% of the benefits come from getting it roughly right ie crude estimates are good-enough for most people.</p>

<p>The first step is to estimate your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), i.e. how many calories you burn in a day. You use energy in two ways: existing (your heartbeat, digesting food, etc) and physical activity (walking, exercising, etc). So, a good estimate of your TDEE will need to take into account both of these.</p>

<p>There are pretty good models for how much energy you use just by existing &ndash; this is called the basal metabolic rate and you can get a very good estimate based on your age, weight, height, and gender. On the other hand, the amount of energy you use for physical activity is highly dependent on your habits (do you take the stairs at work? how many? did you go to the gym?) and your environment (is it cold out?). So, the simple thing that most people do is to just take their BMR and multiply it by some factor according to their levels of physical activity. There are a lot of online calculators that will do these calculations for you.</p>

<p>The second part may seem very crude but it works well enough. In general, the activity-based multiples are biased towards being too high. So, when choosing options in an online calculator choose the ones that make you seem a bit less active than you are.</p>

<p>Once you know your TDEE you can design your diet based on your relevant goals. The most obvious potential goal here is weight gain or loss. If you want to gain weight eat more than your TDEE, if you want to lose weight eat less. Good numbers to start: shoot for having a daily deficit or gain of about 500 calories. If you don&#39;t care about your weight eat as much as it takes to get satiated without feeling stuffed.</p>

<p>The other two parameters of your diet are protein and carbs. You can get a good estimate of how much protein you need from your bodyweight, as I said above, 1g of protein per pound of body weight. As for the carbs (and fats), find something that works for you. In general, you should not eat too many carbs, but if you find yourself eating more carbs than I recommend and meeting all your goals, more power to you. A good number to get started is 200g per day.</p>

<p>In order to finish putting it together you&#39;ll need to write some stuff down. Find all the things you&#39;d like to eat in a day and look at their labels for estimates of their calories and macros. <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">http://wolframalpha.com</a> will also give accurate nutritional information for most things. Add the calories and macros up and try different combinations until you find something that fits the numbers I described.</p>

<p>It is important that you choose to eat foods that you like and can eat without really forcing yourself. In general, try to deviate as little as possible from what you already do. So, if you really like to have your morning pastry, keep doing that and cut your carbs somewhere else.</p>

<p>A regularly-scheduled cheat day when you eat whatever you want and as much as you want is very helpful. For one, it makes everything psychologically easier, and for another some people maintain that this is beneficial in terms of certain hormonal responses. The latter is dubious, but as a psychological hack the cheat day is very useful. Once a week or once every two weeks works well. In particular, having a cheat day is a good way to ensure that you still eat foods which you really enjoy that don&#39;t fit your macros e.g. a pint of ice cream or a jar of nutella. Yes. there. I said it: I eat both of those things just about every Saturday.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Exercise</h1>

<p><em>Think of exercise like a medical drug: you want the minimal dose that is effective.</em></p>

<p><em>You won&#39;t get too big on accident just like you won&#39;t get PhD on accident, you&#39;ll have to work at it.</em></p>

<p><em>Run, Forrest! Run!</em></p>

<p><em>Do you even lift, bro?</em></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gzmoqmL7g">I lift things up and put them down</a>.</em></p>

<p>The first thing above is so important that it bears repeating: seek the minimal effective dose of exercise. The reasons are both psychological and physiological &ndash; for one, workouts that you are doing as quickly as possible tend to be effective (though more dangerous, more on this below), and for another, if your mind perceives going to the gym as something quick and easy you&#39;ll have an easier time getting yourself to do it consistently.</p>

<p>If you have no athletic or aesthetic goals you can probably skip working out altogether, but it is a good idea to be minimally fit. There are a lot of physical fitness assessments you can do to see if you are in good-enough physical condition &ndash; again, what this means is really up to you. The answers to these are good guidelines, though: could you pass the US Marine Corps physical examination? (no, it is not too stringent) Could you outrun anyone who is too strong for you to fight? Can you run a mile in under 10 minutes? Can you go 5 floors upstairs without getting fatigued? Can you do a pullup? Can you pick things up that are at least as heavy as you?</p>

<h2>Injury Risk</h2>

<p>Injury risk is the real cost of any exercise regimen. Failing to account for injury risk is probably the most common offense of exercise guides and workout programs. A notorious offender here is crossfit: while crossfit is very effective (it&#39;ll get you in good shape alright) it will also expose yourself to injuries that may destroy years of progress. Whenever you think about exercise keep in mind the risks involved: certain risks are obvious (e.g. if you lift weights with back form you may injure your back) but some are not (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis</a>).</p>

<p>If your goals require you to take certain risks, so be it, e.g. if you want to practice mixed martial arts competitively, it&#39;ll be virtually impossible to avoid the risk of micro-concussions. However, when your goals are more along the lines of &ldquo;be generally healthy&rdquo; (ie you don&#39;t know what your goals are), err on the side of doing everything with extreme caution and picking safer activities e.g. powerlifting is safer than olympic lifting because the latter requires motions that are much more complex.</p>

<p>Sacrifice progress in order to mitigate injury risk whenever needed. For example, if you sprain your ankle, just stop running until it heals fully. Long term thinking is very important here as certain kinds of injuries are irreversible.</p>

<p>All of this means that when it comes to most exercise proper form is more important than progress. To attain proper form you need to have a feedback loop: get people to critique your form and/or take video of yourself while you exercise as to be able to evaluate your form. Take the time to learn how to perform exercises. To this effect, the time to watch a youtube guide about how to do an exercise is at the gym, right before you do it. Note that this applies to running as well as lifting weights or bodyweight exercises.</p>

<h2>Time Efficiency</h2>

<p>Second to injury risk comes time efficiency. You want to make good use of your time. Besides the obvious, the reasons for this are psychological. If you are sufficiently motivated you can spend three hours a day at the gym and attain a variety of fitness goals, but most people aren&#39;t motivated like that. In general, most people hate working out, so keeping your workouts as time-efficient as possible is a good way to make sure you keep doing them &ndash; duh, it is way easier to build a habit that involves doing something unpleasant for 30 minutes than it is to build a habit that involves doing something unpleasant for 2 hours. Here crossfit is exemplar: most workouts take only a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Walking &amp; Biking</h2>

<p>Walking is likely the only form of exercise you can do that has virtually no injury risk. If you don&#39;t have any aesthetic or athletic goals make sure that you walk a few miles a few times per week. Walking can also be a good way to increase your TDEE for weight-loss purposes. To this effect it can be beneficial to carry some weight on your walks (e.g. a backpack with some books).</p>

<p>Biking is similar to walking, probably slightly more athletically beneficial, but not much unless you really push yourself. Of course, biking comes with slightly more risks than walking, especially if you bike in urban settings without proper biking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that walking and biking won&#39;t get you &ldquo;in shape&rdquo;. These are things to do if you have no athletic or aesthetic goals. Of course, you can use biking to build aerobic endurance, but that is generally bad use of time &ndash; running and HIIT (defined below) are more efficient.</p>

<h2>Weight Lifting</h2>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what your athletic goals should be but you would like to have some baseline of activity higher than what you&#39;d get by just e.g. walking to work, lifting weights is what you should do. Even if you have unrelated specific athletic goals (e.g. run a marathon) lifting weights is still very likely worth your while. Trade some running time for some time lifting weights and your running will improve.</p>

<p>The most common objections to lifting weights are that it is dangerous and that one does not want to &ldquo;get huge&rdquo;. When done with proper form and mindfully (which is easy after a little bit of practice with light weights) weightlifting is one of the safest forms of exercise. As for the second concern: you won&#39;t get huge on accident, to do that you&#39;ll have to follow a stringent weight-lifting regime for a long time, eating enough (and enough protein) throughout. This applies to women, too. Let me repeat, you will not get big, bulky, muscly, or anything of the sort without explicitly working hard specifically towards those things.</p>

<p>Okay, fine, I will lift weights. What do I do? Follow the <a href="http://www.allthingsgym.com/summary-of-stronglifts-5x5/">StrongLifts 5x5 program</a> exactly as prescribed. Another popular beginner weight-lifting program is Starting Strength. Do take the time to learn how to perform the exercises (youtube is your friend) before increasing the weights too much.</p>

<h2>High Intensity Interval Training</h2>

<p>aka HIIT is one of the most effective ways to train your cardiovascular system. At the same time, it is not risk-free. When doing HIIT you should be careful not to over-exert yourself, measuring your heart-rate as you go (at least until you have a good intuitive sense for what may be pushing too hard). The basic idea of HIIT is that you do some very high intensity aerobic activity (e.g. running uphill) for a short amount of time with a bit of rest between bursts.</p>

<p>The most common protocol of HIIT is the Tabata protocol which is 8 sets of 20 second bursts of activity followed by 10 seconds of rest.</p>

<p>When you first read that it sounds easy, right? It actually isn&#39;t. Try doing half: 4 sets of sprinting for 20 seconds and resting for 10. The easiest way to sanity-check that you aren&#39;t over-exerting yourself is to ensure that your heart-rate comes down to ~140bpm during your rest intervals. That is, you should count at most 25 beats during your 10 second rest.</p>

<p>Another form of HIIT involves performing motions that require that you use several independent groups of muscles in rapid succession. A good example of this are burpees. Those look easy until you try doing several in a row.</p>

<p>Crossfit uses a lot of HIIT. However, HIIT coupled with heavy weights and motions that require a lot of coordination (e.g. olympic lifts) are very risky. In general, it is a good rule of thumb to avoid doing anything involving heavy weights quickly.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>Running is good exercise, but similarly to biking is not the best use of time. It is better than biking because you can run at various levels of intensity and to get an aerobic workout you only need to run for 30 minutes or so. Long distance running is still more efficient than biking, but in the same boat of time-efficiency.</p>

<p>Running is a relatively high injury risk activity, though not as high as, say, olympic weightlifting. It is very important to learn to run with proper form (avoid heel-striking, maintain high cadence, lean forward) before attempting long distances.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I run regularly, usually three times per week. One HIIT session, one short run (usually a 5km), and long run (10-20miles). I do the long distance running because I enjoy it and not so much for the health &amp; fitness benefits. As I&#39;ve said before, in terms of those, lifting weights and HIIT are probably much better use of time.</p>

<p>One downside of running is that it tends to interfere with effective dieting. In general, it will be easier to hit your macros without running &ndash; it tends to have the effect of making people hungry and psychologically it is easy to feel like you&#39;ve earned the extra calories. However, a 30 minute run does not burn very many calories, 200-300 or so.</p>
