        <p>Back when I was a first-year graduate student, one of my favorite professors used to get on my case about using pencil instead of pen for my notes and problem sets. I had always liked to do physics and math in pencil. He&#39;d say something like &ldquo;think a little and the commit to it with ink!&rdquo; As I progressed through my studies I realized that my use of the pencil was a symptom of something deeper. I had developed the terrible habit of forming my thoughts by writing equations down, erasing my errors big and small as I went along. This seems, and is, fine at first. But when a complete equation spans multiple lines, involves several abstract objects, some of them with several indices, conventions for when there is an implied-sum and where an integral ends, writing them down as a way to figure out what&#39;s going on ends up taking too long for a good feedback loop to form and it becomes difficult to actually think. I eventually did switch to ink. (And eventually I also stopped studying physics, so if you&#39;re a physics student take everything I say with a grain of salt &ndash; or even better, ignore me altogether!)</p>

<p>These days I spend most of my days writing code. It has been a few years of this and so far I&#39;ve produced very little code that I&#39;m actually proud of. However, a few times, I&#39;ve been proud of coming up with an alternate solution that allowed me to write no code at all, or even better, to delete a bunch of code. Those times have one thing in common: instead of taking a problem and starting to code solutions to it, I&#39;ve taken a step back, gotten away from the keyboard, and just thought about the problem at hand. Writing code is a lot like doing physics in pencil. At first, for simple things, it is usually a fine way to think. However, as the complexity of the code grows, it becomes more and more difficult to keep producing code that runs and also let&#39;s one think. It is usually far superior to think a little and then commit.</p>

<p>It should&#39;ve been obvious to me all along, but it was only this January that my role as a manager at iDoneThis occupied center stage in my mind. Boy do I suck at it. That said, every time I sit down to think about how to be better at it I convince myself that managers are like insurance: in the ideal case you don&#39;t use it. The ideal manager does nothing because the people she manages are autonomous and have everything they need to do their work. Of course, in the real world the workplace is filled with all kinds of issues big and small that need to be resolved in order for work to get done. For example, the office may <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081201/how-hard-could-it-be-my-style-of-servant-leadership.html">need some blinds</a>. So, a more realistic ideal manager occupies his time with that sort of thing: enabling the people he manages to spend their time thinking.</p>

<p>Thinking, not doing.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Well, okay, you have to do some doing also. One useful insight I received this year was from Brendan Schwartz at Wistia, in the context of product design. He recommends 10x thinking. Meaning that to design good products the time spent thinking should be 10x the time spent implementing. This applies more broadly than to product design. Purposeful doing only happens after thinking enough. A manager&#39;s job is to set up the environment for that to happen and then let it happen. Intuitively, I would think that the hard part is only setting up the environment, but letting it happen is plenty difficult, too.</p>

<p>Now, I know nothing of what the workplace used to be a few decades ago, so I might as well romanticize it. I bet you nobody had an activity feed or a dashboard for anything. And while tracking and data are very useful, when it comes to management collecting any data about employees work has a cost. If you are taking data, you are probably not Letting It Happen, TM. (TPS reports, anyone?). So it is more important than in other contexts to be very mindful about what data to collect and analyze, and when. Naively collecting and studying activity data just because the myriad of online services we use produce it sets up a poisonous incentive: doing to appear active. This is certainly not thinking.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the wide availability of data in the modern workplace, is at best, a double edge sword, but it may even be more harmful than good unless a great deal of care is put into what data to collect and when. The successful manager will only want to collect and look at data in such a way that the very activity of doing so does not hamper her employees&#39; ability to spend 10/11ths of their time thinking.</p>

<p>Yeah, just let it happen, man.</p>

    Hi, I'm Rodrigo. I occasionally write essays and short articles here. I'm
    currently participating in the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.
    Before that I was co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://idonethis.com">iDoneThis</a>.
    In a past life I was a graduate student in theoretical physics. Nowadays I
    spend most of my days writing code, but I still do math on occasion. I also
    like to play guitar, stay in shape, and train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
