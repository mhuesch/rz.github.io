        <h1>tl; dr;</h1>

<p>Forget todo lists. Use an online calendar with recurring events instead. Explicitly allocate time for good habits and be specific about how to spend the remainder of your time. Have places where you record stuff for later (e.g. notes, things to read, etc) such that you can do so without a big interruption. Schedule time to review all those places regularly and make sure that you get them to &ldquo;inbox 0&rdquo; each time.</p>

<h1>Todo Lists</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them. &ndash; Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever deleted your todo list and decided to start fresh? Did that also prompt you to re-evaluate the details of your todo list system and what software to use?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dumb solutions to a smart problem beat smart solutions to a dumb problem. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out there is a lot of todo list software out there. My pet-theory is that each time some creative person thought their todo software or system was missing something, they thought the usual creative-person thought: I&#39;ll make one that&#39;s better! The rest of us come up with our own systems and implement them using existing todo list or project management software.</p>

<p>And we all fail three months later, when there is too much stuff and the thing is stressing you out and this and that. We delete it and start fresh and re-evaluate. Meanwhile the creative types are stuck dogfooding their shiny new software. Remember kids, never write software.</p>

<p>So, everyone gets this piece right: there <strong>is</strong> a problem with your todo list system.</p>

<p>The problem is that it is a system for the wrong thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit like being stuck in the woods, trying to run in circles to stay warm while thinking &ldquo;I just need a better system to run&hellip;&rdquo; You don&#39;t need a better running system, you should make a fire, not figure out how to run better.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how good a bridge you build if what you needed was a condo building, even though both can technically provide shelter.</p>

<h1>The Easiest to Fool</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. &ndash; Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over my many failures with all kinds of things I&#39;ve come to like the following question when I encounter something new (be it an idea, a discipline, a tool, a system&hellip;). Is this for self-delusion or for self-honesty?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fool me once, shame on me. Use a fool proof tool, but you&#39;re still cool, fool. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to knock self-delusion too hard here. Self-delusion is bonafide useful.  Very useful, very often, even. Just not always. And that&#39;s for a different essay.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a problem with todo lists: they are a tool for self-delusion. Check it out.</p>

<p>The cost of adding something to your todo list is ~0. A todo list with 3 items may be longer than one with 20. The todo list hides how long each task takes and how it may get blocked. Your todo list doesn&#39;t give you feedback. [1]</p>

<p>At best your todo list is aspirational. [2]</p>

<p>Todo lists sux. [3]</p>

<p>[1]: Even if you kept all the history of your todo list, when you try to analyze what happened you learn very little.</p>

<p>[2]: Some very-productive people are very good at keeping their aspirations attainable and doing other meta-cognitive things. Todo lists may work them. More power to them. I suspect they don&#39;t spend their time reading about productivity on the internet.</p>

<p>[3]: Not all todo lists are called that. Two of the worst offenders are email inboxes and the unread messages in chat software. Those are particularly bad, because in addition to all of the problems above, they let other people add things to your list with ~0 cost.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t rely on motivation, rely on discipline. &ndash; Jocko Willink</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s basically the point, but I really like mixed-proverbs, so I prefer hm&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Relying on motivation is planning to fail. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Motivation is great when you are motivated. The problem is timing. When motivation strikes and how long it lasts is unpredictable. As soon as your mind encounters something interesting you&#39;ll get motivated by that and demotivated to do what you were doing. Further, it is possible to go for long stretches feeling demotivated about everything. I&#39;d argue that&#39;s the common case. It seems to be the case for me.</p>

<p>Motivation sux.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Cognitive Load</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t make me think. &ndash; Steve Krug</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Todo lists were invented to serve a good goal. They were invented to free your brain from having to keep track of what needs to get done. Supposedly, that way you can use your brain for what you need to do instead of for tracking it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fool me once, shame on me. Think twice, shame on me. It ain&#39;t no use in thinking twice, but it&#39;s still alright so long you write it down. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/">advocate just the opposite</a>. Keep track of it all in your head and let yourself forget stuff because you won&#39;t forget what&#39;s important. That probably works for some and probably within a narrow scope. For example, not having a todo list for a side-project may work well. But, your life has a lot of facets, and your brain is not optimized for thinking of the right bits of the right facets at the right times.</p>

<p>I suspect that people who advocate for the approach of not having a todo list actually have much better systems in place for managing their priorities and productivity. They just don&#39;t have an explicit todo list. Further, I suspect that they just tell you &ldquo;I don&#39;t have a todo list&rdquo; and not &ldquo;I have 35 redundant productivity systems in place and none of them use the todo list abstraction&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One way or another, writing things down is good because it frees up your brain. And if you don&#39;t believe that, try to sing a song out loud while bunching skittles into bunches with prime numbers of skittles in each bunch, in order. Could you even read that sentence on the first go?</p>

<p>Cognitive load sux.</p>

<h1>Habits</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand there&#39;s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy. &ndash; Anthony Bourdain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discipline, probably, has some bad connotations in your mind. Probably about being forced to do things you don&#39;t want to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Habitually good is way better than ocassionally great. Optimize for the long term. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if I told you that you can put a positive spin on discipline? It is not a drill sargent calling you maggot and demanding 50 pushups. It is calling yourself by your favorite name and pampering you into doing 50 pushups.</p>

<p>Discipline is doing the things you want to want to do.</p>

<p>Nope, not a typo. Discipline is doing the things you <em>want to want</em> to do.</p>

<p>Want to want is different than want. I <em>want</em> a pint of ice cream and a pack of cookies after eating a 2000 calories worth of steak and pizza for dinner every day. I <em>want to want</em> to be in good physical shape and have low probabilty of cancer and heart disease when I&#39;m old.</p>

<p>Anyway, since discipline is such a bad word, let&#39;s just use another one: habits.</p>

<p>People often treat habits and productivity as separate issues and strategies for habit building can be a deep topic of self-exploration. I&#39;ll just link you to <a href="https://leif.me/2016/09/new-habits-9-tactics-that-worked-for-me/">one post about habit-building</a> that you should read at some point. [1]</p>

<p>There is a cop-out way to see that habits and productivity are basically the same issue. Your mental habits dictate everything you do. And I really do mean everything: how you learn, your emotional responses, how you behave, how you write code, how you do math, how you eat, how you walk, everything. Okay fine, you can&#39;t control things like your heartbeat with your mental habits, but that&#39;s about where it stops.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a cop-out because it is true but not useful &ndash; it is really hard to actually observe your mind working and what habits you have (the habits are particularly hard to see), let alone try to change it (possible, but a lot of work).</p>

<p>How to build habits you want to have is more approachable. This is the gist:</p>

<p>Build one habit at a time.</p>

<p>Get a mechanism that makes you feel good when you do the habit and a little bad (not VERY bad, just a little bad [2]). Apps like <a href="http://wayoflifeapp.com/">Way of Life</a> or physical <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">&ldquo;seinfeld calendars&rdquo;</a> for this.</p>

<p>Start small. Determine what a minimal time commitment is. That is, find the least amount of time you can spend on the habit which will bring the desired benefits. For a lot of things, e.g. meditation or getting started with a musical instrument, this is about 15 minutes. For some other things, e.g. getting in shape, it is more like 60 to 90 minutes. Know why this number is what it is for your habit.</p>

<p>Explicitly allocate that amount of time for your new habit. Schedule it for when you&#39;ll be able to do it. Think of it as having an important meeting. Put it on your calendar, set reminders, the whole nine yards. The CEO of your mind will scold you in front of all of you if you miss this meeting.</p>

<p>Only worry about showing up at first. i.e. don&#39;t worry about how to best use the time, at first. For example, if you are trying to learn the guitar, first, allocate the time &ndash; put it on the calendar with the adequate reminders. Then add a journal for &ldquo;guitar&rdquo; in Way of Life. Then start showing up: pick up your guitar for 15 minutes when you are supposed to. It doesn&#39;t matter what you do so long you have your guitar in hand for 15 minutes. Timers and clocks are your friends.</p>

<p>When you feel like showing up is no problem, start worrying about how to make good use of that time. e.g. get a guitar method and start going through it during your 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Get bigger. When you start feeling intrinsic motivation, allocate more time and figure out good ways to use it. This step is optional for a lot of habits, since you get most of the benefit from just doing the minimal thing e.g. brushing your teeth works this way.</p>

<p>Good habits are awesome.</p>

<p>[1]: Do read Leif&#39;s <a href="https://leif.me/2016/09/new-habits-9-tactics-that-worked-for-me/">post</a>. It is really good. Just not right now. Open it in a different tab and put it on yet another of your failed todo lists: your bookmarklet for saving items to read later. So, leave the tab open, too.</p>

<p>[2]: Only a little bad instead of VERY bad is super important. You don&#39;t want to feel like it is all hopeless as soon as you miss your habit for a few days.</p>

<h1>Self-honesty</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I&#39;ll tell you what you value. &ndash; Joe Biden</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who cares about values, Joe? We are talking about time!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t tell me your priorities, show me your calendar. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good systems for self-honesty have the following features: they capture all the necessary information but not much more, they make tradeoffs explicit and clear, and they provide feedback i.e. it is easy to analyze later.</p>

<p>What time-management tool has all of those features? An online calendar.</p>

<p>Excplitly scheduling your habits and the things you want to want to do won&#39;t be enough, but it&#39;s a start. Start there. This will provide some feedback immediately: you will see at a glance how many hours you have available over the week (or day, or month, or whatever). You will also see at a glance whether you can afford to add one thing or how adding that one extra todo just doesn&#39;t fit unless you sacrifice sleep, or this, or that.</p>

<p>Not only that, looking back on your calendar will be an accurate record of how you spent your time or at least of what you meant to do.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s a start, but not the whole thing.</p>

<p>If you are anything like me, you&#39;ll still have to fight yourself to actually do what your calendar says to do.</p>

<p>Doing as the calendar says can be hard because your mind interrupts the task at hand with other stuff that either is or seems important. This adds cognitive load. You want to elimiate that as much as possible. So, I suggest having one or a few simple systems for unloading things that you want to come back to later. Usually a simple text file with notes or a physical notebook is the best way to start. The most important aspect here is that it be very quick to dump whatever you don&#39;t want to be thinking about into it. Keep your systems as simple as possible until you really understand why complicating them would make them better.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t your notes file or notebook then become a todo list?</p>

<p>It will if you fail to keep it in check. Here is where it all starts coming together.</p>

<p>Regular feedback is very important. Have a regularly scheduled meeting with yourself, during which time you review your notes and calendar, and clean up everything. Ideally you&#39;d empty your notes file during each session. And guess what? Having this sessions is just another habit that you build and schedule in your calendar.[1]</p>

<p>I have had good results with this system. I have a weekly, a monthly review, and a yearly review scheduled indepdently of each other. Each session has a set agenda (just so that it is easy to do it when the time comes) and often they interact e.g. &ldquo;review monthly goals&rdquo; is an item in the weekly session&#39;s agenda.</p>

<p>Self-honesty is awesome.</p>

<p>[1]: Also, once you are in the habit of using your calendar, it&#39;ll seem more natural to schedule time to do something than to add a note about doing it. As your systems develop and start working, the natural way to unload things from your brain will become more obvious and it&#39;ll be your notes file less often. Your notes will start becoming ideas and thoughts instead of todos, or to-reads, or to-whathaveyous.</p>

<h1>The Rambling Mind</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Do what you&#39;re told, and everything will be all right. &ndash; Norman Jewison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most glaring problem that remains to be accounted for is the one of not doing what your calendar says to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. &ndash; ME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that one has been the hardest for me.</p>

<p>Some things that seem to have helped are: lowering my caffeine consumption, drinking less, exercising daily, waking up early, and meditating daily. But I&#39;m not sure about any of them having really helped.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that the habit of doing what your calendar says to do needs to be built like any other habit. Since this is the thing that you have to do most of the time, it is hard to track and train it like the other habits. Furthermore, it probably takes a long time to settle in. The further down the hierarchy of mental-habits a certain habit lives, the harder it is to modify. So it goes.</p>

<p>Or it may be that human minds will always resist doing what they are supposed to do because we evolved for very different tasks and challenges. Who knows?</p>

<p>But I do know that having the calendar, and the reviews, and the habits, and the tracking, and writing notes, and &ndash; they have all added up to me feeling better about how I spend my time. Not self-delusionally better. Self-honestly better. I do more of the things I want to want to do now that I have those systems in place than before having them. I don&#39;t use a todo list.</p>

<p>And done! I just wrote a blog post!</p>
